# Kharcha
Kharcha (ख़र्चा) is the Hindi word for expenditure. 

Kharcha helps you maintain a record of your weekly expenditures. It extracts information from debit SMSes whenever a payment is made. 
* In India, all card holders receive a debit SMS whenever an amount is debited from a bank account. 
* This SMS is typically in the format of _"*Paid Rs. xx to ABC stores*"_
* Kharcha keeps a SMS tracker running in the background to detect any kind of debit SMSes, and adds it into your weekly expenditure list! 
* Presently, Kharcha can detect SMSes from major banks like SBI, ICICI and HDFC! Support for more bank coming soon!
